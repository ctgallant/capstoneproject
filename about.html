                "All Things Hype opened up in July of 2020. We were orignially located in Idle Hands Tattoo Parlor located in Wichita at Douglas Ave and Seneca. We had a small store
                set up in there and moved when we were expanding. Business was rough at the beginning. We were doing appointments until March of 2021. Since March we have been open everyday.
                <br />
                <br />
                We carry Nike, Adidas, Converse, Bape, Supreme, Anti Social Social Club, and a Kansas City brand called R Lamar. We also sell sports cards and streetwear.
                <br />
                <br />
                Sales have been better than ever towards the ends of 2021. I have 600 pairs of shoes and counting. I buy new inventory weekly. I own this store solely, have one part time worker at the moment,
                and have a marketing agency attached to my store.
                <br />
                <br />
                I started this store because I love sneakers and the culture around it. I grew up reselling shoes. I never imagined habing my own shop. I have ended up making it my full time occupation and I couldn't be happier.
                As of December 2021, my store has grown so much. My lease is up in July for the buliding I am currently in and I am looking for a bigger and better location!"
